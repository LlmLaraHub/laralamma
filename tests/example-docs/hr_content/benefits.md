As an employee, I am eligible for a range of benefits, including comprehensive health insurance, a 401(k) retirement plan with company match, and employee discounts on company products and services. How do I enroll in these benefits, and what are the deadlines for making changes to my benefits? I can enroll in benefits during my onboarding process, and I will receive an email with instructions on how to log in to the benefits portal. The open enrollment period for benefits is typically held in November of each year, and changes to benefits can be made during this time. Outside of open enrollment, changes to benefits can be made with a qualified life event, such as a marriage or birth of a child. If I have any questions or concerns about my benefits, I should contact the HR Benefits Coordinator, Karen Thompson.
