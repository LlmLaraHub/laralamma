Performance Evaluation Process

The performance evaluation process is conducted annually, with a mid-year review and a formal evaluation at the end of the year. The evaluation will assess my progress against my job description and set goals for the upcoming year. Who will be conducting my performance evaluation, and what are the key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be used to evaluate my performance?
