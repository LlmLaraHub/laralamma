Time Off and Leave

As an employee, I am entitled to 15 paid vacation days per year, 10 paid sick days per year, and 5 paid family leave days per year. How do I request time off, and what is the process for approving or denying my request? To request time off, I should submit a request at least 2 weeks in advance through the company's online time-off system. The request will be reviewed by my supervisor, Rachel Lee, who will approve or deny the request based on business needs and availability. If my request is denied, I will be notified and provided with an alternative date or option. Are there any blackout dates or restrictions on taking time off during peak periods? Yes, the company has a policy of not approving time off requests during the week of our annual company-wide meeting, which typically takes place in late October. Additionally, requests for time off during the holiday season (December 15th to January 1st) may be subject to approval on a case-by-case basis.
