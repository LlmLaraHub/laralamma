Ibuprofen and naproxen make up the majority of NSAID prescriptions in the East Midlands, but in some areas, they only account for half of all NSAID prescriptions.\n\n5. **Prescribing Guidance**: The summary recommends that NSAIDs should be prescribed for the shortest time and lowest dose necessary to control symptoms.",

Recent cohort data have confirmed previous safety warnings that diclofenac has a higher risk of thrombotic events (including Mi and stroke) than naproxen or low-dose ibuprofen. Even a few days of treatment may increase risk, both in healthy individuals and those with cardiovascular disease. High doses of ibuprofen may also have an increased risk.
